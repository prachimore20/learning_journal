# ATPG and DFT Learning Notes

Although I haven't implemented ATPG flows in a project yet, I've spent time learning about core DFT concepts and how they apply to real-world RTL and SoC design.

## ðŸ§  Topics Covered
- Scan-chain insertion and scan flip-flops
- Stuck-at fault models (SA0, SA1)
- ATPG generation flow overview
- Fault coverage metrics and test pattern generation
- Basics of DFT tools (e.g., Synopsys DFT Compiler, Tetramax)

## ðŸ”§ What's Next
- Plan to implement a scan chain in a 4-bit ALU or counter
- Simulate fault detection using manual fault injection
- Document the RTL + DFT flow as a mini-project

## âœ… Goals
- Strengthen understanding of DFT fundamentals through hands-on exploration
- Demonstrate initiative and readiness for entry-level DV or DFT-focused roles
- Show recruiters and hiring managers a willingness to learn beyond coursework
- Secure a full-time position where I can contribute to RTL design or verification involving DFT methodologies
